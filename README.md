# Joon Challenge

## Setup

* Install Docker
* run `./joon setup`

## Development

Use your editor of choice, code is in the `challenge` folder.
Start a container shell with: `./joon start`
You can open as many shells as you'd like.

## Challenge

Add a new endpoint at `/employees/report.csv` that will respond a CSV file with:

* Employee name
* Employee email
* Employee start date
* Total employee benefit
* Average employee benefit (per month)

The goal of this challenge is not completion, is to check how we interact, how you reason and how you tackle problems.
I don't care if the end result works or not.
